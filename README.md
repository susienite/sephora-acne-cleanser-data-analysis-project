# Sephora Acne Cleanser Data Analysis Project
Acne is a common skin condition in which areas rich in sebaceous glands are clogged. This can result in many types of lesions like whiteheads, blackheads, papules, pimples, nodules, and severe nodular acne. Acne affects people of all races, but is most common in teens and young adults. There are many treatment options available depending on the severity of the acne from topical to systematic. Topical acne cleansers sold in drugstores without a prescription or by retailers have lower concentrations of active ingredients and while they may undergo through testing, the scientific evaluation is not as rigorous as medical-grade products (braviaderm.com/). 
A good acne cleanser usually contains ingredients that address the main causes of acne, such as excess oil, blocked pores, bacteria, and inflammation. Key characteristics include exfoliating agents, anti-bacterial agents, oil/sebum regulation, hydration and skin barrier support, anti-inflammatory agents, and non-comedogenic ingredients. Active skincare ingredients often serve multiple functions. For instance, salicylic acid not only exfoliates and clears pores, but also helps regulate oil production and provides anti-inflammatory benefits. Hence, the highlighted ingredients listed for the cleanser were  categorized into exfoliating vs. moisturizing because those are two main effects. 
The questions below were formulated to analyze the types of exfoliating vs. moisturizing ingredients used. I also wanted to know which brandsâ€™ acne cleansers were the most popular vs. the least popular. Finally, I wanted to know if more expensive acne cleansers are worth it.
 
The analysis questions are as follows:

What exfoliating active ingredients are most commonly used in acne cleansers?
What moisturizing active ingredients are most commonly used in acne cleansers?
What acne cleansers from Sephora are the most popular?
What acne cleansers from Sephora are the least popular?
Is there a correlation between cleanser formulation and popularity?
